## **Overview of Analysis**

### ***Purpose***

A researcher wants to create a process to better navigate and filter data from UFO sightings. The goal of the design is to make it easy and fast to peruse high volumes of sighting data based on a variety of data points, such as date, city, state, country, and shape.


## **Results**

The sequence below highlights the steps to leverage the website to sort multiple data points around UFO sightings.

First, go to the UFO Sighting Website.

<br>

The visitor will notice the data to the lower half of the screen and a search filter to the left of the screen.

Next, go to the "filter search" section of the webpage.

<br>

At this stage, the user can type in any specific data they want. By starting more broad, the likelihood of returning more data is higher. Once more filters are applied, the data set should decrease to more specific instances. 

For example, if the user types in "co" for the state of Colorado. The following data is returned:

<br>

If multiple criteria is desired, the user simply adds in additional filters to get to a desired data set.

## **Summary**


### ***Snapshot of Recommended Changes/Further Development***

***Drawback***

Some initial drawbacks of this new design can be both aesthetics and functionality. The website design is plain and not as engaging upon visiting. Regarding functionality, the website has "stagnant data" which means it is not actively populating new sightings when they occur.

***Further Development***

The aesthetics can be enhanced to make the website more appealing and engaging to the user, through added images, color, and table design. Regarding functionality, processes for web scraping can be added to ensure data is updated regularly for users so that it includes the most recent sightings.
